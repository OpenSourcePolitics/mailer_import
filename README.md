# Mailer_import
Following the work done on [Matomo](https://github.com/OpenSourcePolitics.eu/matomo_import), we implement here a tool that aims to import data from mailer managers (Sendinblue, Mailjet) into data files that can be then analyzed in your favorite analyzing tool (in our case [Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase)).

## Work in progress
- [] Setup CI/CD
- [] Minimal test suit
- [] Make script run for Sendinblue and Mailjet
